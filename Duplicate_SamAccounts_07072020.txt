                I ran the following script on the Bryton “jump box”:

                Get-ADUser | Format-Table SamAccountName > "C:\Temp\SamAccountNames_Outfile2_07062020.csv" 

              Which gave me a file with a list of all the Sam Accounts for the Bryton ‘domain’. Next, in Excel, for each row I added to column B:

                =IF(MAX(COUNTIF(A1:A94, A1:A94))>1,"Duplicate","No Duplicate")

                Which compares the name in that row to all the names to see if any ‘duplicates’ matches……..the resulting file is now in the Bryton Teams Files Share called “SamAccounts_07072020.xlsx”.
